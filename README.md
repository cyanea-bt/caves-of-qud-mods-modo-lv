## Training

Each of the following categories has its own rate of training (how quickly the skill can be unlocked), configurable in mod's options. 


### Melee Weapons

Using melee weapons in combat can train their corresponding base skills ([Axe](https://wiki.cavesofqud.com/wiki/Axe), [Cudgel](https://wiki.cavesofqud.com/wiki/Cudgel), [Short Blade](https://wiki.cavesofqud.com/wiki/Short_Blade) or [Long Blade](https://wiki.cavesofqud.com/wiki/Long_Blade)), as well as single or multi weapon fighting.

A melee weapon skill training increases every time you attack an enemy, if all the following are true:
* The target is successfully hit (with or without damage).
* The target is a creature (destroying walls or trees is not combat).
* The weapon is an equipped item (no natural weapons like fists or claws).
* The weapon is in the main hand (off-hand weapons don't train weapon skills).
* The attacking weapon has an associated skill to train (whips will not train anything).

Single/multi weapon fighting:
* If the attacking weapon is the only one equipped, [Single Weapon Fighting](https://wiki.cavesofqud.com/wiki/Single_Weapon_Fighting) will also be trained, at **half** the rate of the weapon skill.
* If the attacking weapon is equipped in an off-hand, it won't train its weapon skill, but will train [Multiweapon Fighting](https://wiki.cavesofqud.com/wiki/Multiweapon_Fighting) at **double** the rate of the weapon skill training.

## Missile weapons

Successfully hitting the targeted creature in combat trains the associated missile weapon skill ([Bow and Rifle](https://wiki.cavesofqud.com/wiki/Bow_and_Rifle), [Heavy Weapon](https://wiki.cavesofqud.com/wiki/Heavy_Weapon), or [Pistol](https://wiki.cavesofqud.com/wiki/Pistol)).

A missile weapon skill training increases every time you attack an enemy, if all the following are true:
* The target is a creature (shooting walls and trees doesn't count).
* The target is successfully hit (with or without damage).
* The target is the one originally aimed at (hitting something else by accident doesn't count).


## Thrown weapons

[Deft Throwing](https://wiki.cavesofqud.com/wiki/Deft_Throwing) skill training increases every time you successfully hit the targeted enemy with a thrown weapon (with or without damage).

Note that this is an individual skill (a "power"), rather than a skill tree -- unlocking it will not automatically make the rest of the [Tactics](https://wiki.cavesofqud.com/wiki/Tactics) tree available.
