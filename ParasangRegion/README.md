# Overview

Adds a letter to parasang names to indicate which of the 9 regions (zones) the player character is in.

# Details

This is an alternative to "Show Parasang" mod. "ParasangRegion" works correctly with game version 1.0, and the zone name changes are not permanent.

The markers are:

```
NW | N | NE
---+---+---
 W | C | E
---+---+---
SW | S | SE
```

# Uninstall

The mod is safe to add or remove at any point.
