# Overview

A simple mod allowing to lose skills by wishing for `SkillGone`. Meant for modders, challenge runs etc., as vanilla wishes can only gain skills, not remove them.

# Features

* Wishing for `SkillGone` shows a menu of all known skills and powers.
* Selecting a skill from the menu will ask for confirmation and offer a choice of recovering the skill points that the skill normally costs.

# Uninstall

The mod is safe to add or remove at any point. It does not change anything about the game content or mechanics, merely adds a new wish command.
