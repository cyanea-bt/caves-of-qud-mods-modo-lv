# Overview

Characters with [Heightened Hearing](https://wiki.cavesofqud.com/wiki/Heightened_Hearing) or [Heightened Smell](https://wiki.cavesofqud.com/wiki/Heightened_Smell) mutations will not interrupt autoexploring if they detect an enemy that isn't targeting them. They will, however, stop just short of melee range.

# Uninstall

The mod is safe to add or remove at any point.
