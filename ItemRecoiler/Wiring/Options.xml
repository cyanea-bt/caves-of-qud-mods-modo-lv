            If enabled, every character will start the game with an item recoiler in the inventory. Existing characters will also have one automatically added after installing the mod.

            Control whether imprinting an item recoiler creates a holographic receiver at the location.&#10;&#10;Receivers make it more convenient to manage items at the drop sites (through a container window, rather than just picking up off the ground), but will be left over if the mod is uninstalled. It shouldn't break anything though (they're just tweaked vanilla chests).&#10;&#10;Disabling this does not remove existing receivers, that can be done safely with {{B|turn off}} interaction (removes items first, available while the mod is enabled), or unsafely with a {{B|destroy}} wish (you must remove items yourself!).
